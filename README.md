# Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Example for Cordova

This example app demonstrates how to integrate the [Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Cordova Plugin](https://scanbot.io/developer/cordova-barcode-scanner-plugin/) with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) and [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com).

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Cordova Plugin is available as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-scanbot-barcode-scanner).

Our branch strip_ios_simulator_arch demonstrates how to strip the x86_64 simulator architecture from the iOS build.

For more details about the Plugin please see this [documentation](https://docs.scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/cordova/introduction/).


## What is Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK?

Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is a simple to use high level API, providing a collection of classes and functions for scanning and parsing 1D and 2D barcodes from your mobile device's camera or other image sources like your photo library.


## Trial License

The Scanbot SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!

After the trial period has expired, all SDK functions and UI components will stop working. You have to restart the app to get another one-minute trial period.

To test the Scanbot SDK without crashing, you can get a free ‚Äúno-strings-attached‚Äù trial license. Please submit the [Trial License Form](https://scanbot.io/trial/) on our website.

## Free Developer Support

We provide free "no-strings-attached" developer support for the implementation & testing of the Scanbot SDK.
